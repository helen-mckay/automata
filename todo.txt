        - link to my portfolio website
    - example
        - ineractive example
        - representation of finite state machine
            - updates to reflect changes in application state
        - thoughts / explanations about the example

- needs
    - overall base layout
    - introduction section
    - consistent styling for example sections -> could be a layout or a component
