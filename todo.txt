- placeholder text for intro section -> done
- make very simple finite state machine (night mode toggle?) -> can just be text that updates, no ui for now; do this in its own feature branch
    - interactive
    - machine representation
- brainstorm how to manage the data for the examples -> will they have their own folder?
- research solution for moving section to section using keyboard
- set up automatic deployments on vercel (updates with main branch pushes)
- set this project to be on a subdomain of my portfolio website
- feature this project on my portfolio website
- comment all the files very nicely

Planning:
- sections -> each takes up entire screen (user can navigate between them with keyboard, button, or scrollbar)
    - introduction
        - why finite state machines
        - technology used
            - Robot3
            - React
            - Next.js
            - style component library
        - link to my portfolio website
    - example
        - ineractive example
        - representation of finite state machine
            - updates to reflect changes in application state
        - thoughts / explanations about the example

- needs
    - overall base layout
    - introduction section
    - consistent styling for example sections -> could be a layout or a component
    - global styling
    - styling for introduction section
    - styling for example sections

Notes:
- Chakra UI only works on client-side components ('use client')
